# FlowSim


This is a copy of the original work of FlowSim (but adding PUMML). Will fix this README later


Code for training the models of the paper: [End-to-end simulation of particle physics events with Flow Matching and generator Oversampling](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad563c) ([arXiv:2402.13684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13684)).

## Generate data
To generate 100k events (about 500k jets) for training on a ttbar dataset, run data/generator.py
```
  python generator.py 100000 "gen_ttbar_100k_.npy" --ttbar --seed=$seed 
```
NOTE: Pythia and FastJets must be correctly installed

NOTE: The data used in the origianl paper is also available through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11126625).

## Train model

To train the best model from the paper, run the src/train_cfm.py with the provided config:

```
python train_cfm.py CRT.yaml
```

the python packages required are listed under requirements.txt
